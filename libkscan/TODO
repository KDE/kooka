Our TODO List:
1. Fri Oct 13 14:09:15 CEST 2000 - Nikolas Zimmermann
  
   *** Part 1 - Class Design ***
   
    We'll need two main-classes called "KScanDevice" and "KScanDialog" 
    which include the following sub-classes:
    
    "KScanDevice" - low level hardware access (SANE Controlling)
	o "KScanOption" - setting/getting SANE States/Values
	o "KGammaTable" - calculating gamma, brightness and contrast
	o "KScanSlider" - our slider-widget
	o "KScanCombo" - our combo-widget
	o "KScanEntry" - our label-widget

    "KScanDialog" - a nice-looking standard dialog for scanning
    
   *** Part 2 - libkscan in YOUR app ***
   
    You'll have to start the function "launchScanDialog" in KScanDialog,
    which provides you the complete Scanning Dialog.
    ie. ( _not_ working sample)
    void do_something_with_the_final_image( QImage final )
    {
     // foo
    }
    void scan()
    {
     KScanDialog *foo = new KScanDialog( this );
     connect( foo, SIGNAL( finalScanFinished( QImage ) ), SLOT( do_something_with_the_final_image( QImage ) ); 
     foo->show(); 
    }
    
    Any simpler ideas ? :)
    
    Klaas Freitag <freitag@suse.de>:
    No, that sounds quite good to me. Could it be simpler ?
    One thing to remember: Scanning is a time consuming task, is KScanDialog modal for the app?

    OK, trying to find smaller portions of work to do ;)
    Trying to write down the status of the classes here.

    Probably all classes need:
    - a cleanup of the code. Lots of unused stuff may be deleted.
    - a debug concept. By now, the function debug() is used, but probably that not state of the art?
    - a rewrite/cleaning to adept to Qt 2.x
    - the gui functionality KDE 2.x - features.
    - KDE-features at all ! The whole stuff does not use any KDE-funcitonality, only Qt.
      What about having a Version which compiles without KDE ? .o0( Good idea to think about ? )
    - attention to drop QString where possible, and I think, its possible where SANE-stuff is
      used.
    - I18N-functions. In resource.h, I defined a macro I18N which does not much by now. I tried
      to place it around strings to prepare for real I18N treatment. How is that done ?
    - C++ - cleanup. Nearly no class has proper default and copy constructor and stuff...

    KGammaTable: an abstrct data type
       - seems to work more or less for 255-color images. Does not work for palettes with more entries.

       - needs documentation

    KScanDevice: logic scanner device.
       - has mixed code for the widget-factory (getGuiElement) and the logic scanner. Dont know if 
         that is cool, or if we should participate that.
       - Has the sane scanner handle  as a modul global variable. Thus, only one scanner handle can
         be used in one application. 
       - No net device yet. I never had a look for it, and if it works or not. I only disabled it to
         cut down complexity.
       - ... much more 
       - should be able to load and apply option sets (see there).       

       - needs documentation

    KScanOption:
       - has no possibility to be applied immediatly after being set. That might be a real problem
         in some cases. Good ideas are welcome.
         By now, the Option can be set and needs to be applied (means sent to the scanner device)
         by a call to the apply method in KScanDevice. After that, it could be checked, if other
         options changed thereby. Thats fine under the aspect of a good OO design, but might cause
         problems in case a option is changed and there is no possibility to call apply.

       - needs documentation

    KScanOptSet: 
       - needs possibility to be stored and loaded in/from KDE-configuration files. Example:
         Option set (including resolution, gammatables etc.) for photos, for ocr, bla...
       

    KScanSlider: 
       - needs a neutral button in the widget !

    KScanEntry : 
    KScanCombo : 

    ... much more.
