Scanning with Kooka and KScan
=============================

Kooka and KScan use the SANE library to attach to the scanner
hardware.  It cannot be avoided by any library that a program sends
commands to the scanner which can damage it. Especially very cheap
scanners sometimes do not have a hardware protection against driving
the bed to far, which can cause terrible noise and damage  :-(

That is why you should be warned running Kooka or the KDE scanservice
the first time. Even if there were no reportings that something bad
happens to any scanner models using Kooka yet, but it can not be
garanteed.

Starting to scan the first time, be sure to sit next to your scanner
having your hand on the power-off switch.  Switch off immediately if
you hear unexpected noises or if something strange happens.

If you find errors, please dont ask the SANE-people without having
made sure that your error is _really_ a SANE error. Most probably, you
found an KScan or Kooka-Error, which should be reported at
