Added support for calling the external ocr program gocr of Joerg
Schulenburg and friends.  See http://jocr.sourceforge.net for
details. Mind that still everything is under construction, even if
there could be some interesting screen hots around.

OCR works best with smaller parts of text scanned black-and-white 
scanned with about 150 dpi.
