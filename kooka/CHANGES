-> Nov. 2000, Klaas Freitag <freitag@suse.de>:
initial version

- December 2000, Klaas Freitag <freitag@suse.de>:

Added support for calling the external ocr program gocr of Joerg
Schulenburg and friends.  See http://jocr.sourceforge.net for
details. Mind that still everything is under construction, even if
there could be some interesting screen hots around.

OCR works best with smaller parts of text scanned black-and-white 
scanned with about 150 dpi.
 
-> Released version 0.2 on kde.org

- December 2000, Klaas Freitag <freitag@suse.de>:

* Reworked the ocr integration: Nice start- and finish-dialog,
  animated status image, opening a text editor with the result text
  via mime mechanism of KDE (KRun). OCR-Parameter get stored via KConfig.
  OCR may be performed on the entire image or the selection.

* Reworked the save assistant: New layout and fully KDE2-Compliant.
  Still no new Image format help texts.

* Reworked the startup dialog: Allows to select the scan device from a
  list of available devices, possible to set the startup scan device
  'forever'.

* Resizing of the scan parameters. The scan parameters shell should
  take as much as space as it needs. It is not longer fix sized now.

* Mirroring in three kinds of the displayed image with toolbar and menubar
  entries. That needed that the packager is able to handle changes on already
  saved images.

* Creation of new images from the selection on the image canvas.

- Jan 2001, Klaas Freitag <freitag@suse.de>:

* Rotating of images. 

* Opening images in a kde graphic app.

* Proper error messages if a changed image cant be saved.
