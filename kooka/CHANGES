-> Nov. 2000, Klaas Freitag <freitag@suse.de>:
initial version

- December 2000, Klaas Freitag <freitag@suse.de>:

Added support for calling the external ocr program gocr of Joerg
Schulenburg and friends.  See http://jocr.sourceforge.net for
details. Mind that still everything is under construction, even if
there could be some interesting screen hots around.

OCR works best with smaller parts of text scanned black-and-white 
scanned with about 150 dpi.
 
-> Released version 0.2 on kde.org

- December 2000, Klaas Freitag <freitag@suse.de>:

* Reworked the ocr integration: Nice start- and finish-dialog,
  animated status image, opening a text editor with the result text
  via mime mechanism of KDE (KRun). OCR-Parameter get stored via KConfig.
  OCR may be performed on the entire image or the selection.

* Reworked the save assistant: New layout and fully KDE2-Compliant.
  Still no new Image format help texts.

* Reworked the startup dialog: Allows to select the scan device from a
  list of available devices, possible to set the startup scan device
  'forever'.

* Resizing of the scan parameters. The scan parameters shell should
  take as much as space as it needs. It is not longer fix sized now.

* Mirroring in three kinds of the displayed image with toolbar and menubar
  entries. That needed that the packager is able to handle changes on already
  saved images.

* Creation of new images from the selection on the image canvas.

- Jan 2001, Klaas Freitag <freitag@suse.de>:

* Rotating of images. 

* Opening images in a kde graphic app.

* Proper error messages if a changed image cant be saved.

* drag and drop support: Pull an image from konqueror on the scanpackager !
  The image wil be importet.

* print support (basic)

* basic configuration support 

  ... and losts of other, small bug fixes, unfortunately not mentionend very
      well here. Sorry for that, I will try to do better.

- July 2001, Klaas Freitag <freitag@suse.de>

  Now it should be, if it is checked, the format-Dialog will not be
  displayed again.

* added a new section Image saver to the properties dialog

* some changes to the image saver to display the image type (Lineart etc. )

* bugfixes in the image Saver

/* ================================================================================ */
Nov 2001:
Added a combo box below kooka's gallery widget. Since the gallery and the
the preview window are in a tabwidget together, user complained that they
do not see the directory they are scanning to while working on the preview
page. The combobox shows the currently selected directory and is always
visible. The user can use the combo to change the target dir without leaving
the preview page.

Nov 2001:
Replaced the old ScanPackager object by a new one based on the new KFileTreeView
Widget in kdelibs/kfile. Hopefully soon full KURL support and more than one image
repository.

Nov 2001:
Moved preview image to a hidden directory under $KDEHOME/share/apps/ScanImages/.previews
That makes the preview images invisible in the Packager.
