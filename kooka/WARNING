Kooka Warning !
==============

Kooka and KScan is software in very early state. It is not error free. 
Kooka may damage your Scanner hardware.

KScan was tested with SANE 1.0.3 and SANE 1.0.4 with the Umax and Mustek backends. 
It is not reported to work error-free on even these two !! But it does not damage
the scanner ;)

PLEASE BE EXTREMELY CAREFULL if you try to run kooka ! It may shredder your 
scanner. Be sure to sit next to your scanner having your hand on the power-off
switch whenever you start scanning with kooka. Switch off if you hear unexpected
noises or if something strange happens.

If you find errors, please dont ask the SANE-people without having made sure
that your error is _really_ a SANE error. Most probably, you found an KScan
or Kooka-Error !
