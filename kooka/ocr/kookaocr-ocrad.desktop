Comment=<emphasis>OCRAD</emphasis> is an free software OCR engine by Antonio&nbsp;Diaz, part of the GNU&nbsp;Project.<nl/><nl/>Images for OCR should be scanned in black/white (lineart) mode. Best results are achieved if the characters are at least 20&nbsp;pixels high. Problems may arise, as usual, with very bold or very light or broken characters, or with merged character groups.<nl/><nl/>See <link url="http://www.gnu.org/software/ocrad/ocrad.html">www.gnu.org/software/ocrad/ocrad.html</link> for more information on OCRAD.
