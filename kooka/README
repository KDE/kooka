Kooka
 
Kooka is a raster image scan program for the kde2 system.  

It uses the SANE-lib for which you find more information under
http://www.mostang.com/sane/
It also uses a related activity kscan, which will be a kde2 module for
scanner access. Kooka is the first program using the kscan module.

KScan and especially the 'walking ants' in Kookas image-canvas are based
on the 1997 work of Ivan Shvedunov <ivan_iv@rf-hp.npi.msu.su>, his homepage
can be found at http://rf-hp.npi.msu.su.

KScan and Kooka are under construction. Dont expect everything to work
fine.
