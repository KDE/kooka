Kooka
=====
 
Kooka is a raster image scan program for the KDE2 system.  
     
   PLEASE READ THE FILE "WARNING" FIRST !
   Using kooka may damage your hardware !

It uses the SANE-lib (http://www.mostang.com/sane/) and the the
KScan-library which is a KDE2 module for scanner access.


KScan and Kooka are under construction. Don't expect everything to work
fine. If you want to help, send patches to freitag@suse.de.

Features:
=========

Kookas main features are:

SANE:
- Scanner support using SANE. Kooka _DOES_NOT_ support all features that SANE
  and its backends offer. It takes a small subset of the available options.
- Kooka offers a gui to change the most important scanner options like resolution,
  mode, threshold etc. These options are generated on the fly,  depending on the 
  scanner capabilities.
- Kooka offers a preview-function and the user can select the scan area interactively.

Image storage:
- Kooka provides an assitant to save your acquired images.
- Filenames are generated automatically to support multiple scans.
- Kooka manages the scanned images in a tree view where the user can delete and
  export images. 

Image Viewing:
- Scanned images can be viewed by clicking them in the tree view.
- The viewer has a zoom function.

OCR:
- Kooka supports Joerg Schulenburg's gocr, an open source program
  for optical character recognition. Kooka starts the OCR program and displays 
  its output. Best results with bw-images scanned with ~150 dpi


Problems:
=========

* Kooka does not yet support all options SANE offers. That will
improve in the future. However, I dont know if it makes sense to
support all, even not very common options, some scanner offer. Lets
see what is neccessary and makes sense for the purpose of kooka.

* KDE2 seems to have problems running on other displays. Kooka suffers
from that if you start kooka on your host and try to get a remote
display. All of the Qt-Widgets are displayed properly, but the image
appears completely black. On the terminal, a lot of errors like

KDE detected X Error: BadShmSeg (invalid shared segment parameter) 155
  Major opcode:  143

appear. Dont know why.

* Kooka does not yet have a strategy for very large images :(. It uses
the Qt QImage/QPixmap as is. On some displays, that causes problems.
